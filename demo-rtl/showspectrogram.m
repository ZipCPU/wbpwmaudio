%% Filename: 	showspectrogram.m
%%
%% Project:	A Wishbone Controlled PWM (audio) controller
%%
%% Purpose:	To generate a spectrogram image which can then be used to
%%		evaluate the wavfp.dbl file produced by the pdmdemo executable
%%	in this directory.
%%
%%	This script has been tested with Octave, and it is known to work with
%%	Octave.  While it may work within Matlab as well, no representation is
%%	being made to that effect.
