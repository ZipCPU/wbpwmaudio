%% Filename: 	mymap.m
%%
%% Project:	A Wishbone Controlled PWM (audio) controller
%%
%% Purpose:	This file generates my favorite spectrogram color map.  The map
%%		is designed so that zero maps to black, and one maps to white.
%%	In between the two extremes, the color goes from black to blue, red,
%%	orange, yellow, and then white.
%%
%%	The one argument given to the colormap is the number of colors
%%	you would like to have in your map.  64 is often sufficient.
